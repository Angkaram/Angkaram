- Hello, I’m Angelo Karam.
- I’m interested in embedded systems, computer vision, natural language processing,  and much more!
- I’m currently working on my Computer Science degree, along with minors in Mathematics and Physics at Sacramento State University.
- Looking for internships to get real-world programming skills that are not taught in school. 
- How to reach me: angelokaram@gmail.com

# 1. 
  A past research [project](https://github.com/Angkaram/Angkaram/blob/main/Astrophysics_Research_Poster.pdf) I have worked on was titled "Assessing the Accuracy of Binary Star Detection Methods using Numerical Simulations of Star-Forming 
  Clouds". 
  The project entailed a series of programs created using Python and Dr. Aaron T. Lee's simulation data of star-forming clouds. These programs enabled the user to observe 
  3D star-forming systems (natal microcosm) from a random viewing angle, creating a 2D projection of the 3D data. These programs
  included sophisticated mathematical functions that were hand written into the Python program. We then used the programs and observed/noted that:
  - True binary star systems are determined based on physics — their mutual gravitational interactions keep them bound to one another. The
    simulation data provided me enough information to calculate this.
  - Perceived binaries systems are determined by finding the “smallest” apparent separation between stars in my projections.
Lastly, I asked: Are the perceived binaries (the stars labeled as binaries by my programs) the actual binaries (those flagged as true binaries from the simulation data)? This question was ultimately answered with some statistical analysis of the generated data compared with the input simulation data. 

  There was an emphasis on science communication for this project. This meant that any and all aspects of the project had to be easily understandable by a 
  non-scientific audience. A demonstration of this clear communication can be found in a poster I created with Dr. Aaron Lee, my mentor for the 
  internship. 
  - This poster can be found in this repository, with the title "Astrophysics Research Poster" [(here)](https://github.com/Angkaram/Angkaram/blob/main/Astrophysics_Research_Poster.pdf).

# 2. 
  A React JS web application with a [Vendia](https://www.vendia.com) backend. This project was created to enable a pharmaceutical study. Scrum methodology used with me as the team lead and [Rahul Gupta](https://github.com/rahulio96) as co-leader. 
  The client's (Vendia) goal was for us to build a proof of concept distributed information system with suitable user interfaces that could be used by the FDA, 
  pharmaceutical companies, and participating health care providers to exchange study data as it is produced (i.e., in near real time) in a 
  secure, trusted (i.e., auditable), and controlled (i.e., minimally permissive) manner. Using the Vendia 
  Share platform, we had support for data exchange through an immutable, cryptographically verifiable, distributed ledger that provides the primitives 
  to control data flow (e.g., redaction).

# 3. 
  I am currently working with a team of Software Engineers to build our client a ML model and UI that will grade students' homework/tests using Computer Vision and NLP. This project is currently in progress but the repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Very-Bad-Goose/Senior-Project).

  Stay tuned!
