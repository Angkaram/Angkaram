- Hello, I’m @Angkaram
- I’m interested in Neural Networks, remote sensing AI models, natural language models, and much more!
- I’m currently working on my Computer Science degree, along with minors in Mathematics and Physics at Sacramento State University.
- Looking for an internship to get real-world programming skills that are not taught in school. 
- How to reach me: angelokaram@gmail.com

# Current and past projects include:

# 1. 
  A [past](https://github.com/Angkaram/Angkaram/blob/main/Astrophysics_Research_Poster.pdf) project I have worked on was titled "Assessing the Accuracy of Binary Star Detection Methods using Numerical Simulations of Star-Forming 
  Clouds". 
  The project was done using Python and Dr. Aaron T. Lee's simulation data of star-forming clouds. The code we created allowed me to observe the 
  three-dimensional star-forming systems from a random viewing angle, creating a two-dimensional projection of the three-dimensional data. This 
  included sophisticated mathematical functions that were hand written into the Python program. We then looked at:
  - True binary star systems are determined based on physics—their mutual gravitational interactions keep them bound to one another. The
    simulation data provides me enough information to calculate this.
  - Perceived binaries systems are determined by finding the “smallest” apparent separation between stars in my projections.
  - Finally I ask: Do the labels agree? Are the perceived binaries the actual binaries?

  I focused on science communication for this project. This meant that any and all aspects of the project had to be easily understandable by a 
  non-scientific audience. A demonstration of this clear communication can be found in a poster I created with Dr. Aaron Lee, my mentor for the 
  internship. 
  - This poster can be found in this repository, with the title "Astrophysics Research Poster" [(here)](https://github.com/Angkaram/Angkaram/blob/main/Astrophysics_Research_Poster.pdf). The code for this project is set to private since
    the star-forming cloud simulation data is copyrighted. 

# 2. 
  A more recent project I have worked on is a pharmaceutical study web application I created alongside my peers at Sacramento State University. I 
  was officially the leader of this project, so I had to ensure all members contributed quality code in a timely manner, while also providing them 
  with my time if they had questions. Another team member (Rahul Gupta) also helped lead the group when I was unavailable or needed assistance. 
  The project began with a real client (Vendia) asking us for very specific goals, use cases, and non-functional requirements. The main goal was 
  as follows: To build a proof of concept distributed information system with suitable user interfaces that could be used by the FDA, 
  pharmaceutical companies, and participating health care providers to exchange study data as it is produced (i.e., in near real time) in a 
  secure, trusted (i.e., auditable), and controlled (i.e., minimally permissive) manner. We will build our information system on top of the Vendia 
  Share platform, which supports data exchange through an immutable, cryptographically verifiable, distributed ledger and provides the primitives 
  to control data flow (e.g., redaction). 
  The code and other information on this project can be found in my public repository [here](https://github.com/Angkaram/Pharmaceutical-Study-Web-App-Project)

# 3. 
  Creating a fully functioning website using the React library. The goal is to familiarize myself with the dynamic, complex, and relevant 
  landscape of web design. Currently learning JavaScript and HTLM in a class setting, but will apply those skils to personal projects. I will post 
  some of my code as soon as I get a more refined aesthetic.

# 4. 
  I will continue to build on my skills and develop more exciting projects. 
  Stay tuned!
