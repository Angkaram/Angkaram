- 👋 Hi, I’m @Angkaram
- 👀 I’m interested in Neural Networks, remote sensing AI models, natural language models, and much more!
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my Computer Science degree and Mathematics and Physics minor at Sacramento State University.
- 💞️ Looking for an internship to get real world programming skills that are not taught in school. 
- 📫 How to reach me: angelokaram@gmail.com

- Current and past projects include:

1. A past project I have worked on was titled "Assessing the Accuracy of Binary Star Detection Methods using Numerical Simulations of Star-Forming Clouds". I focused on science communication for this project written in Python. This meant that any and all aspects of the project had to be easily understandable by a non-scientific general audience. A demonstration of this clear communication can be found in a poster I created with Dr. Aaron Lee, my mentor for the internship.

2. Creating a fully functioning website using the React library. The goal is to familiarize myself with the dynamic, complex, and relevant landscape of web design. Currently learning JavaScript and HTLM in a class setting, but will apply those skils to personal projects. I will post some of my code as soon as I get a more refined aesthetic.

3. As someone who is new to Computer Science, I will continue to build on my skills and develop more exciting projects. 
Stay tuned!
