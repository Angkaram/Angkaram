- Hi, I’m @Angkaram
- I’m interested in Neural Networks, remote sensing AI models, natural language models, and much more!
- I’m currently working on my Computer Science degree and Mathematics and Physics minor at Sacramento State University.
- Looking for an internship to get real world programming skills that are not taught in school. 
- How to reach me: angelokaram@gmail.com

- Current and past projects include:

1. A past project I have worked on was titled "Assessing the Accuracy of Binary Star Detection Methods using Numerical Simulations of Star-Forming Clouds". 
The project was done using Python and Dr. Aaron T. Lee's simulation of star-forming clouds. The code we created allowed me to observe the three-dimensional star-forming systems from a random viewing angle, creating a two-dimensional projection of the three-dimensional data. We then looked at:
  - True binary star systems are determined based on physics—their mutual gravitational interactions keep them bound to one another. The simulation data provides me enough information to calculate this.
  - Perceived binaries systems are determined by finding the “smallest” apparent separation between stars in my projections.
  - Finally I ask: Do the labels agree? Are the perceived binaries the actual binaries?

I focused on science communication for this project. This meant that any and all aspects of the project had to be easily understandable by a non-scientific audience. A demonstration of this clear communication can be found in a poster I created with Dr. Aaron Lee, my mentor for the internship. 
  - This poster can be found in this repository, with the title "Astrophysics Research Poster". The code for this project is set to private since the star-forming cloud simulation data is copyrighted. 

2. Creating a fully functioning website using the React library. The goal is to familiarize myself with the dynamic, complex, and relevant landscape of web design. Currently learning JavaScript and HTLM in a class setting, but will apply those skils to personal projects. I will post some of my code as soon as I get a more refined aesthetic.

3. I will continue to build on my skills and develop more exciting projects. 
Stay tuned!
